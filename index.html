# CSS Organization & Architecture

---

class: center, middle

# Brief History of Methodologies

---

class: middle

# 2009 - OOCSS
## Object Oriented CSS

Nicole Sulivan - @stubbornella - Yahoo

- Separate Structure & Skin
- Separate Container & Content
- Foundation of newer methods

---

class: middle

# 2011 - SMACSS
## Scalable Modular Architecture for CSS

Jonathan Snook - @snookca - Yahoo

- Further Categorization... Base Layout Module State Theme
- id selectors for important elements
- classes for theme, state, layout
- prefixed classes with l- m- is-

---

class: middle

# 2013 - BEM
## Block Element Modifier 

Yandex

- start of component based methodologies
- classes for everything
- Focus on elements, then how those elements behave inside a block
- modifier classes for altering appearance/behavior

---

class: middle

# 2016 - ITCSS
## Inverted Triangle CSS

Harry Robers @csswizardry

- start with very generic styles
- refine as specificity increases
- trumping - absolute specificity

---

class: center, middle

#### Combining OOCSS/SMACSS/BEM/ITCSS...
# SMOOBEMIT...

---

class: middle

# Architecture

---

class: middle

# Start With The Foundation

- Style base first - eg. Globals, Colors, Typography, etc.
- Add resets as needed 

_PLEASE_
- Don't nuke everything with Eric Meyers Reset
- If you don't know what to reset... Pick and choose what you need from normalize.css

---

class: middle

# Adding A Room

- Start defining block classes (containers)
- Semantic naming: name what it is, not how it looks.
- lisp-case, spinal-case, kebab-case... whatever hypenated words is called.

```scss
.site-search {} /* block */
```

---

class: middle

# Put Things In The Room

- Define element classes as they behave inside the block
- name should suffix parent block class with `__thing`
- consider their behavior inside a different block
- how about when that block is in another block?


```scss
.site-search {} /* block */
.site-search__field {} /* element */
.site-search__button {} /* element */
```

---

class: middle

# Painting The Room

- Add modifying classes. eg: full, rtl, primary
- two hyphen suffix `--primary`

```scss
.site-search {} /* block */
.site-search__field {} /* element */
.site-search__button {} /* element */

.site-search--rtl {} /* block */
```

---

class: middle

# Finished Room

```html
<form class="site-search site-search--rtl">
  <label class="site-search__label">Site Search</label>
  <input class="site-search__field">
  <button id="fancy" class="site-search__button button--primary">Search</button>
</form>
```

```scss
label {}
input {}
button {}

.site-search {}
.site-search__label {}
.site-search__field {}
.site-search__button {}

.site-search--rtl {}
.button--primary {}

#fancy { font-family: 'Comic Sans' } /* trump */
```

# Organization

---

class: middle

# Settings

A place for your global things: variables; colors; environment settings;

Keep like-settings together, Typography, colors, margin/padding etc.

```sh
_settings.global.scss
_settings.typography.scss
_settings.colors.scss
_settings.box-sizing.scss
```

---

class: middle

# Tools

Mixins, extends, functions. 

```sh
_tools.functions.scss
_tools.mixins.grid.scss
_tools.mixins.colors.scss
_tools.extends.typography.scss
```

---

class: middle

# Generic

Box-sizing, resets (don't use resets), selections...

```sh
_generic.box-sizing.scss
_generic.normalize.scss
_generic.selection.scss
```

---

class: middle

# Element

HTML Elements, __Not__ Classes.
img, button, input... 
Keep grouped by type

```sh
_elements.headings.scss
_elements.links.scss
```

---

class: middle

# Objects

Start declaring classes here.
Non-cosmetic styles.
Grids, Wrappers, Cards, Media...

```sh
_objects.grid.scss
_objects.wrapper.scss
_object.media.scss
```

---

class: middle

# Components

Now our classing will get more specific. You shouldn't have any declarations without at least specificty level of 1 class. 

Once the project is setup, most of your time will be in component files.

```sh
_components.site-nav.scss
_components.buttons.scss
_components.carouself.scss
```

---

# Trumps

Avoid at all costs.

Trumps have absolute specificity.
!important should only ever appear here. _Try to avoid them_
ID selectors belong here. 

```sh
_trumps.clearfix.scss
_trumps.utilities.scss // just for Gray ;)
_trumps.ie8.scss
```

# Things to remember

- Start small - you don't need the kitchen sink if you don't have a kitchen.
- Think about the box-model, don't start overriding things without asking why.
- Group things together
- Break out declarations into their own files as early as necessary. Even if overkill.
- No one true way to do this.
- Mix'n match what you like
- Use semantic names for your classes.

---

class: middle

# Other CSS Things

- Classes > Attributes > IDs > Tags
- SCSS files should be prefixed with underscore
- when importing, you can skip the prefix and the extension
- You probably don't need those helper classes.

# Things I've Learned At Stembolt

class: middle

## How to frustrate Clarke

- use Gnome
- nmap <C-d> to :bd!

---

class: middle

## How to annoy Gray

- Helper classes
- Extraneous properties
- Magic numbers!
  - calc(50% - #{$gutter-vertical + $gutter-underline-spacing + 10px})
- %extends
- Data-uri 
```css
background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,
      %3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' 
        fill='#ffffff' width='100' height='100' %3E
        %3Cpath d='M99 50L1 99V1z'/%3E
      %3C/svg%3E
");
```
- blank lines
- override properties because you can
- `*, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; }`

## Naming Continued
$color-red - implies color red. Will always be red-ish
$color-primary - Not a color - but implies it's important
$color-accent - not a color - but implies it's complimentary to other colors.

### controversy of colors
$color-white - is white. Not off white, not #eee, just #fff;
$color-gray - gray covers the gradient from black to white
$color-gray--darkest - could be black, could be #222 you don't need to care about the value, just that it's the darkest shade on the page
$color-gray--light - lighter than the median gray
$color-gray--lightest - opposite of darkest
