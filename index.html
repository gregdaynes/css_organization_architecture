# CSS Organization & Architecture

---

class: center, middle

# Brief History of Methodologies

---

class: middle

# 2009 - OOCSS
## Object Oriented CSS

Nicole Sulivan - @stubbornella - Yahoo

- Separate Structure & Skin
- Separate Container & Content
- Foundation of newer methods

---

class: middle

# 2011 - SMACSS
## Scalable Modular Architecture for CSS

Jonathan Snook - @snookca - Yahoo

- Further Categorization... Base Layout Module State Theme
- id selectors for important elements
- classes for theme, state, layout
- prefixed classes with l- m- is-

---

class: middle

# 2013 - BEM
## Block Element Modifier 

Yandex

- start of component based methodologies
- classes for everything
- Focus on elements, then how those elements behave inside a block
- modifier classes for altering appearance/behavior

---

class: middle

# 2016 - ITCSS
## Inverted Triangle CSS

Harry Robers @csswizardry

- start with very generic styles
- refine as specificity increases
- trumping - absolute specificity

---

#### Combining OOCSS/SMACSS/BEM/ITCSS...
# SMOOBEMIT...

class: middle

# Architecture

---

class: middle

# Start With The Foundation

- Style base first - eg. Globals, Colors, Typography, etc.
- Add resets as needed 

_PLEASE_
- Don't nuke everything with Eric Meyers Reset
- If you don't know what to reset... Pick and choose what you need from normalize.css

---

class: middle

# Adding A Room

- Start defining block classes (containers)
- Semantic naming: name what it is, not how it looks.
- lisp-case, spinal-case, kebab-case... whatever hypenated words is called.

```scss
.site-search {} /* block */
```

---

class: middle

# Put Things In The Room

- Define element classes as they behave inside the block
- name should suffix parent block class with `__thing`
- consider their behavior inside a different block
- how about when that block is in another block?


```scss
.site-search {} /* block */
.site-search__field {} /* element */
.site-search__button {} /* element */
```

---

class: middle

# Painting The Room

- Add modifying classes. eg: full, rtl, primary
- two hyphen suffix `--primary`

```scss
.site-search {} /* block */
.site-search__field {} /* element */
.site-search__button {} /* element */

.site-search--rtl {} /* block */
```

---

class: middle

# Finished Room

```html
<form class="site-search site-search--rtl">
  <label class="site-search__label">Site Search</label>
  <input class="site-search__field">
  <button id="fancy" class="site-search__button button--primary">Search</button>
</form>
```

```scss
label {}
input {}
button {}

.site-search {}
.site-search__label {}
.site-search__field {}
.site-search__button {}

.site-search--rtl {}
.button--primary {}

#fancy { font-family: 'Comic Sans' } /* trump */
```

class: middle

# Settings

A place for your global things: variables; colors; environment settings;

Keep like-settings together, Typography, colors, margin/padding etc.

```sh
_settings.global.scss
_settings.typography.scss
_settings.colors.scss
_settings.box-sizing.scss
```

---

class: middle

# Tools

Mixins, extends, functions. 

```sh
_tools.functions.scss
_tools.mixins.grid.scss
_tools.mixins.colors.scss
_tools.extends.typography.scss
```

---

class: middle

# Generic

Box-sizing, resets (don't use resets), selections...

```sh
_generic.box-sizing.scss
_generic.normalize.scss
_generic.selection.scss
```

---

class: middle

# Element

HTML Elements, __Not__ Classes.
img, button, input... 
Keep grouped by type

```sh
_elements.headings.scss
_elements.links.scss
```

---

class: middle

# Objects

This is where we get to OOCSS. We start defining classes here.
Objects should be non-cosmetic styling. Things like grids, or wrappers, cards, media.

```sh
_objects.grid.scss
_objects.wrapper.scss
_object.media.scss
```

---

# Components

This is where you start putting the UI together. Once the project is setup, you'll spend most of the time in these files. 
Now our classing will get more specific. You shouldn't have any declarations without at least specificty level of 1 class. 

```
_components.site-nav.scss
_components.buttons.scss
_components.carouself.scss
```

---

# Trumps

You don't want to ever have to be in these files. The declarations in Trumps beat everything else for specificity. If you're using an `!important` it better be in here. I'll throw ID selectors and classes in here if necessary.

```
_trumps.clearfix.scss
_trumps.utilities.scss // just for Gray ;)
_trumps.ie8.scss
```

Takeaways
---------

Start small. You don't need the kitchen sink.
A little bit of thinking goes a long way. Think about what your trying to style.
No one true approach 
Mix'n match

CSS
---

classes good / ids bad / attributes neutral?
- performance tests required

CSS organization is subjective. Do what you want. But think first.

Mix with care - you can mix and match your methodologies - I like the idea of SMACSS prefixes. I like BEM. BEMACSS!

# File/folder structure
- assets/stylesheets/
- split up at logical groupings.
- my common files
- - variables
- - typography
- - mixins
- - layout/structure
- - components = block
- - - site-header
- - - site-footer
- - - colophon
- - - hero-unit
- - - etc

# Imports
- we have them, please use them.
- @import "file_name"; // scss no prefix _ no extension

# Splitting files up
- File getting large? Move associated blocks/elements out to a new file, and import it.

# Helpers/Utilities
- greenfield project? Not at the start. Start building, once you see common patterns, refactor.
- Existing project? Look for existing patterns. Refactor.

# Normalisation 
*, *:before, *:after {
/* Zero all the things! */
}

# Naming
Sucks. Good luck.
Following BEM
Break down elements into their smallest pieces - like atomic.

Palmar (palm side) (anterior) 
Dorsal (back side)

```
.hand // block
.hand--right // modifier
.hand__finger .finger // block in a block
.finger // block
.finger__nail .nail // block in a block
.nail // block
.nail__cuticle // element
.nail__crest // element

.finger .distal-phalanges
.finger .intermediate-phalanges
.finger .proximal-phalanges
```

```
.hand .hand--right
.hand__finger .finger .finger--index
.finger__nail .nail
.nail__cuticle
.nail__crest
```

## Naming Continued
$color-red - implies color red. Will always be red-ish
$color-primary - Not a color - but implies it's important
$color-accent - not a color - but implies it's complimentary to other colors.

### controversy of colors
$color-white - is white. Not off white, not #eee, just #fff;
$color-gray - gray covers the gradient from black to white
$color-gray--darkest - could be black, could be #222 you don't need to care about the value, just that it's the darkest shade on the page
$color-gray--light - lighter than the median gray
$color-gray--lightest - opposite of darkest

#Things I've Learned At Stembolt

## How to frustrate Clarke

- use Gnome
- nmap <C-d> to :bd!

## How to annoy Gray

- helper classes
- utilities
- extraneous properties
- magic numbers!
- calc(50% - #{$gutter-vertical + $gutter-underline-spacing + 10px})
- %extends
- data-uri background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' fill='#ffffff' width='100' height='100' %3E%3Cpath d='M99 50L1 99V1z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");
- blank lines
- override useless properties
- *, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; }

# 2016 - Atomic Design

Brad Frost @brad_frost

- classes for everything
- Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages
- Atom: HTML Tag
- Molecule: Collection of Atoms - eg: Search Form
- Organism: Grouping of Molecules - eg: Site header (with Search form ;) )
